Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy appreciate the lack of humidity
Consider adding Venus as a base
An ill-considered change
It is quite dark here, but I see someone with a big nose, could be an alien!
I see some aliens with doctors lab coats, this must be another clue!
